### What is Smart India Hackathon (SIH)?

Smart India Hackathon [(SIH)](https://www.sih.gov.in/) 2020 is a nationwide initiative to provide students a platform to solve some of the pressing problems we face in our daily lives, and thus inculcate a culture of product innovation and a mindset of problem solving. More than 5 LAKH+ students across 65+ Locations in India.

### Problem Statement 

Problem Statement : Data analytics to provide complete solution for groundwater management for the country
Problem Statement ID - DM 84


### Our Solution

Our solution - [IndiaGWanalytics.in](https://gwl-dashboard.herokuapp.com/) is a application that provides visualization of Groundwater scenario in India with GIS mapping, graphs and various analysis tools along with state of the art ML models to predict groundwater trends. 

Our solution helps the Ministry of Central Ground Water Board to evaluate and study the trends of groundwater levels accross <b> 28 States, 500+ Districts , 6000+ Blocks of the past 25 years </b>. These trends are divided into 4 seasons (Pre Monsoon, Post Rabi farming season, Post Kharif farming season). We also use diffrent time series algorithms like ARIMA, SARIMAX, VARMAX, HWES etc to predict trends and classify an area as Critical, Semi-Critical or safe. This helps the ministry to plan the resources wisely and effectively accross India.

<br>



Our solution can be divided into below mentioned components:

* #### Visualization 
    - Geo Location based Heat maps
    - State and District wise maps
    - Week, Month, Year wise maps
    - Season (Pre Monsoon, Pre Farming etc.) wise maps

* #### Query and Analysis
    - Identify Improving or Declining locations
    - Compare Trends (Pre vs Post Monsoon etc.)
    - Clustering of Critical, Semi-Critical, Safe areas
    - Time Series Analysis using ARIMA, EWMA etc.
    
* #### Reports Generation
    - Export heat maps and graphs
    - Statistical reports
    - Bar graphs, Pie chart, Trend analysis etc
